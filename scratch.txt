NGINX - add filebeat to container (maybe some other beats)
official image softlinks access.log and error.log to stdout/stderr, so that needs to be changed (probably best to have Beats in the same nginx container)

- Log rotation - logrotate comes installed in the official image

Need elasticsearch running somewhere to output to
docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.4.3
